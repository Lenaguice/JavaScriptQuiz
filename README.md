Without the Developer trailblazers like Jamie Morris, novice developers like myself could never become the trailblazers themselves.  I respect the developing footprints of Jamie Morris' work and all students and developer professionals that have come before me. I will earnestly endeavor to build a solid understanding of front-end development.
